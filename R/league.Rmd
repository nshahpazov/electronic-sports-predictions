```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library("tidyverse")

```

```{r cars}
league_df <- read.csv("./data/lol/LeagueofLegends.csv")
champions_df <- read.csv("./data/lol/riot_champions.csv")

league_df %>% dim

```

И тук имаме някакъв клас имбаланс

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
champions_df[league_df]
league_df %>%
  mutate(blueTopChamp = champions_df[champions_df$Name == blueTopChamp]$Id)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}


```
